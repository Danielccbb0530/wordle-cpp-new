# This is the new repository for [wordle-cpp](https://github.com/Davidasx/wordle-cpp).

# The old repository was discarded because of large numbers of excess files. Excess files greatly slowed down cloning times and I had to create a new repository.

# If the program can't run, please download [VC Redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

# Thanks for your support! Wordle has been here for two and a half years, and thanks everybody who support me.
